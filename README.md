# crashs=Cruise+ASHS
CRASHS is a surface-based modeling and groupwise registration pipeline for the human medial temporal lobe (MTL). It is used to postprocess the results of [ASHS](https://github.com/pyushkevich/ashs) segmentation with ASHS atlases that contain a white matter label. CRASHS uses the [CRUISE](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.06.043) technique implemented in the [NighRes software](https://nighres.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to fit the white matter segmentation with a surface of spherical topology, and find a series of surfaces spanning between the gray/white boundary and the pial surface. The middle surface is inflated and registered to a population template, allowing surface-based analysis of MTL cortical thickness and other measures such as functional MRI and diffusion MRI.
